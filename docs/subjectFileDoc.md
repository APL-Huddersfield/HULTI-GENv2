# Subject File Documentation

To avoid overlap and repetition when creating results file templates, it should be outlined what the subject files should contain.

## Required keys

* Subject identifier
* Associated config (use MD5 hash calculated from the config file)
* Model
* Task
* Results data

The *Model* and *Task* keys are clone from the associated config for the sake of readability when the experimenter is analysing their results.

## Results data

All result values in HULTI-GEN are sorted in the following way:
```
session > group > trial > response value(s)
```
As implied by the plural, a given trial can contain multiple response values, for example in MUSHRA test.

Sessions and groups are object arrays, whilst trials are arrays of keys with an associated response value array.
